- Started a new project, known as "Petal". The objective of this project will be to create a working prototype for a character 
action game based on the web series "RWBY".
- To start with, I have copied my existing project "Zenos" which I will use as a base to work from.
- Replaced the standard knight model with a basic red mannequin.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Planned out the work required for the "basic premise" prototype, in which the general arena and structure of the prototype will be
built.
- Created a new flat landscape, using an obtained snow material (may require more changes later).
- Created a new skybox, showing a dark night sky. Also, created a moon structure for use in said sky.

- Lowered the depth of the terrain for the player spawn area.
- Added an invisible barrier around the players spawn area, to act as the perimeter for the "arena".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 19/05/2022

- Added some wind sound effects that play randomly to add some ambience.
- Added some falling snow particle FX to the arena area.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 20/05/2022

- Added some simple tree models, and used them to create a "forest" surrounding the arena area.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 23/05/2022

- Updated the version of UE4 used from 4.25.4 to 4.27.2.
- Added a pause menu that can be controlled with both mouse and keyboard, as well as a gamepad.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 24/05/2022

- Added a main menu screen that the player will see upon first opening the game.
- Experimented with breakpoints and the debug system, to ensure they are ready to be used for future development.
- Created a rough post-premise plan, which is designed to identify all the elements needed for the final version of Petal.
- Added a basic loading screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 25/05/2022

- Adapted post-premise plan to Trello board.
- Created a basic scythe model, which replaces the currently used sword model.
- Hitbox and attacking functions altered to still somewhat work with the scythe (although new animations will still be needed).
- Hitbox re-sizing has been disabled, as it has little effect on the scythe due to its shape. The parameters for it, will not be
yet removed though, as I feel we may still need them later.
- Adjusted the snow particle FX to warm-up for five seconds worth of time before starting the level.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 26/05/2022

- Added a basic "dodge" ability, that allows the player to move very quickly in their faced direction. (The idea is that this
ability will allow the player to be immune from enemy attacks while active, although that cannot be implemented until we actually
have enemy attacks).
- Added greater direction control for the dodge ability.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 27/05/2022

- Allowed the player to pass through enemies when using the dodge ability.
- Rebound the hotkey for the dodge ability on keyboard, to fix and issue with recognising the input (gamepad is unchanged).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 30/05/2022

- Began work on the shooting function.
- Added a fire bullet function to the scythe that traces a line to other pawns, creating some sparks if an enemy is found.
- Added a sound effect and animation to the shooting function.
- Restricted the shooting function to only be usable when not doing other things.
- Moved the shooting function into a newly created parent class for the scythe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 31/05/2022

- Began working on the "aiming" mode for the shooting function.
- This mode should transition the gameplay into something similar to a third person shooter, until the player chooses to switch back.
- Currently have basic animations implemented for aiming in this mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 01/06/2022

- Adjusted camera to move closer to, and stay behind, the player when they are aiming.
- Added movement animations for aiming mode.
- Altered shooting animation to show player movement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 02/06/2022

- Implemented firing during aiming mode.
- Altered shooting function to hold more of the original blueprint logic.
- Added a crosshair that appears during the aiming mode.
- Prevented sprinting during aiming mode.
- Prevented lock-on and aiming mode being active at the same time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 06/06/2022

- Overhauled the use of many different boolean integers for the player character. Now, these values are held as a TArray (BusyChecks)
which cannot be accessed directly, instead only by a set of functions (IsBusy, IsBusyMulti, and SetBusy).
- Added comments to code about the player character, to help illustrate which values are being checked and why.
